# TicTacToe
TicTacToe Game Using Python

The game consists of two modes: Single player and Multiplayer.

In the Single player mode, I implemented the 'Minimax Algorithm' which is a backtracking algorithm widely used in two-player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, etc. Here Computer is the maximizer and the user is the minimizer.

The Multiplayer mode enables two human players to play against each other, taking turns in the classic Tic Tac Toe style.
